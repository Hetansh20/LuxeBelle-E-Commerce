## Database Setup

This project uses MySQL as its database. Make sure you have MySQL installed and running on your system.

1. Create a new MySQL database for the project.
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file with your MySQL connection string.
3. Run `npm run migrate` to apply the database migrations.
4. Run `npm run generate` to generate the Prisma client.

For database management, we recommend using MySQL Workbench.
